                                   (ROCFOMFS)

Look, it is not my fault. I'm just trying my best here to make Fallout 4 mods
work on Linux. It is the unwanted legacy of case insensitive file systems.

The essential idea is to have separate directories for individual Fallout 4
mods, take the following structure for example,

  mods/ScrapEverything
  mods/TrueStorms
  mods/DarkerNights
  mods/LongerPowerLines

we want to merge those in some pre-defined order with the standard Fallout 4
data directory. Individual mods might override the same files. The overlay
exposes the final version of the file, as if it was overwritten by the final
mod.
