               Read Only Case Folding Overlay Merging File System
                                   (ROCFOMFS)

Look, it is not my fault. I'm just trying my best here to make Fallout 4 mods
work on Linux. It is the unwanted legacy of case insensitive file systems.

Introduction

  The essential idea is to have separate directories for individual Fallout 4
  mods, take the following structure for example,

    Mods/TrueStorms
    Mods/LongerPowerLines
    Mods/ScrapEverything

  we want to merge those in some pre-defined order with the standard Fallout 4
  data directory. Individual mods might override the same files. The overlay
  exposes the final version of the file, as if it was overwritten by the final
  mod.

  ROCFOMFS uses FUSE to expose a case insensitive read only virtual file system
  that merges a list of overlapping directory layers into a single directory
  tree. Layers can be specified both directly over the command line (-l option)
  and also using a layer specification file (-L option).

  Layer precedence is based on the position, either within the specification file
  or on the command line. The last layer takes precedence. The layer file is
  processed first.

Example use

  Assumptions

    (1) ROCFOMFS is executable and located inside the Fallout 4 directory
    (2) The original Data directory has been renamed to Data.Vanilla

  ./ROCFOMFS \
    -l Data.Vanilla \
    -l Mods/TrueStorms \
    -l Mods/LongerPowerLines \
    -l Mods/ScrapEverything \
    Data

Installation and requirements

  ROCFOMFS requires python-fuse library.
